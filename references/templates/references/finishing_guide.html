                        <li>Load the brush properly - about 1/3 of the bristle length</li>
                        <li>Apply with the grain using long, even strokes</li>
                        <li>Maintain a wet edge to prevent lap marks</li>

                <h4>Wood Preparation Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Complete All Construction First:</b>
                        Finish all woodworking operations including joinery, shaping, and carving before starting the finishing process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Sanding Progression:</b>
                        Start with coarser grits and work up to finer grits. A typical progression might be: 80 → 120 → 150 → 180 → 220 grit. For some finishes, you may need to go finer to 320 or 400 grit.<br>
                        <span class="text-muted">Always sand with the grain. Cross-grain scratches will show in the final finish.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Raise the Grain:</b>
                        For water-based finishes, raise the grain first by lightly wetting the surface with water, letting it dry, then lightly sanding with the final grit.<br>
                        <span class="text-muted">This prevents the grain from raising when applying water-based finish.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Surface Cleaning:</b>
                        Remove all dust using a vacuum, compressed air, and/or tack cloth. Mineral spirits can be used to check for missed spots and to reveal glue residue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Wood Conditioning:</b>
                        For blotch-prone woods (pine, cherry, maple, birch), apply a pre-stain wood conditioner or washcoat of thinned shellac before staining.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Filling the Grain:</b>
                        For open-grained woods (oak, ash, mahogany), consider using wood filler or grain filler for a smooth finish.<br>
                        <span class="text-muted">Apply filler after staining but before applying finish if you want the pores to show the stain color.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Final Wipe Down:</b>
                        Just before finishing, wipe the surface with a clean, lint-free cloth to remove any remaining dust.
                    </li>
