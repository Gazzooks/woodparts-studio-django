    <p class="mb-3">
        Understanding lumber grades helps you select the right wood for your project, whether for structural framing, fine woodworking, or cabinetry. Lumber is graded based on appearance, strength, and intended use. Below are the most common grading systems for softwoods and hardwoods.
