        <h4>What Does "Finish Compatibility" Mean?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Mixing Liquids:</b> Only mix products with the same base (oil with oil, water with water). Never mix oil-based and water-based liquids directly.<br>
                <span class="text-muted">[<a href="https://www.popularwoodworking.com/finishing/flexner-on-finishing-finish-compatibility/" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Popular Woodworking: Finish Compatibility">2</a>]</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Layering Finishes:</b> Most stains, fillers, glazes, and finishes can be layered if the previous coat is fully dry and not wax-based. <b>Wax is the exception:</b> Nothing sticks well over wax.<br>
                <span class="text-muted">[<a href="https://www.popularwoodworking.com/finishing/flexner-on-finishing-finish-compatibility/" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Popular Woodworking: Finish Compatibility">2</a>]</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Stain & Finish Base:</b> For best results, use a stain and finish with different solvents (e.g., oil-based stain under shellac or water-based finish). If using the same base, add 15–20% of the finish to the stain as a binder.<br>

        <h4>Key Rules for Finish Compatibility</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Never apply a finish over wax.</b> Wax is always the last step.</li>
            <li><b>Let each coat dry fully</b> before applying the next. Rushing leads to adhesion problems.</li>
            <li><b>When in doubt, use dewaxed shellac as a universal sealer</b> between incompatible layers.</li>
            <li><b>For stains and polishes:</b> Prefer stains and finishes with different solvents (oil under spirit, etc.). If using the same base, add 15–20% finish to the stain as a binder.<br>

            </li>
            <li><b>Test first!</b> Always test your finishing schedule on a scrap piece of the same wood.</li>

        <h4>Factors Affecting Compatibility</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Project Type:</b> Outdoor projects need finishes with UV and moisture resistance (e.g., spar varnish, exterior poly).<br>
                <span class="text-muted">[<a href="https://octaneseating.com/blog/wood-finishes/" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Octane Seating: Wood Finishes Guide">1</a>]</span>
            </li>
            <li><b>Exposure to Sunlight &amp; Humidity:</b> Water-based and varnish finishes offer better resistance for outdoor or high-use items.<br>
                <span class="text-muted">[<a href="https://octaneseating.com/blog/wood-finishes/" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Octane Seating: Wood Finishes Guide">1</a>]</span>
            </li>
            <li><b>Skill Level:</b> Wipe-on and water-based finishes are easier for beginners; French polish and lacquer require more skill.<br>
                <span class="text-muted">[<a href="https://octaneseating.com/blog/wood-finishes/" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Octane Seating: Wood Finishes Guide">1</a>]</span>
            </li>
            <li><b>Desired Color:</b> Shellac and lacquer can add warm tones; water-based finishes stay clear.<br>
                <span class="text-muted">[<a href="https://octaneseating.com/blog/wood-finishes/" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Octane Seating: Wood Finishes Guide">1</a>]</span>

    <div class="results-frame">
        <h5>Troubleshooting &amp; Resources</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>If a finish won’t dry or peels, check for wax or oil contamination and ensure each layer is fully dry.</li>
            <li>If in doubt, use dewaxed shellac as a barrier coat between layers.</li>
